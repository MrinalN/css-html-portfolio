<h1>Simple Portfolio</h1>
<h3>CSS Essentials Exercises turned 'Smallest Footprint" website prototype.</h3>

# ðŸ’¡ About

<b>Simple Portfolio</b> began as a CSS Essentials Linkden Learning repo, based on lessons by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/christina-truong">Christina Truong</a>. After completing the certification, I began playing with my own stylings and built a simple node.js, express backend with intention to launch. I started asking questions about 'Lightweight' or 'Green' websites, questioning what is the least amount of bulk/ dependencies/ installs one needed to put up a basic website. These conversations with senior devs and research have been insightful. Though packages have made website building accessible to almost anyone, most of the 'magic' has been abstracted. Not using dependencies requires a fair bit of skill with the basics. I look forward to continuing my experimentation on building the 'Smallest Footprint' website.

# ðŸŒŸ What I learnt on this project
- How to do more without the bells and wistles
- How to effectively orgainize my CSS files
- New CSS procedures (this was a learning gap in my bootcamp training)
- Reaffirmed my ability to quickly setup a backend
- How to organize large html/ limiting imports to limit steps during render
